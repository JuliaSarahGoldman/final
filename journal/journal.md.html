2016-11-14: Obj files working
=============================================================
Got .obj files to work.  Problem was that .off files start at index 0, but .obj files start at index 1.  The solution to this was to add 1 to each of our vertex indexes in our faces.


2016-11-13: Obj file as an OFF file

![](2016-11-13_014_starter_r2322_g3d_r977__.jpg)

This is testing.obj which when made into an off file works perfectly fine

=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_013_starter_r2322_g3d_r977__.jpg)

The Object Parsing seems to be incorrect. The syntax must be really wrong. This
was simply editing the obj file to become and off file on a 2 recursive level
sphere.



2016-11-13: Left-Hand vs Right-Hand Rule...
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_015_starter_r2326_g3d_r977__.jpg)

Sooooo.... Object files use the opposite rule???



2016-11-13: Attempting to combine mesh and planet
=============================================================

2016-11-13: BevelEdges
=============================================================
Plan:
Split up triangles- blow out. (So add to vertices in direction of face normal? But make every vertex multiple vertices. So, for each triangle of ints, construct an actual triangle, change the ints, (make a new vertex array and index array when testing).) (Should probably get this working before anything else.)

Then, fill in the gaps. So, need way to iterate. Iterate over the edges, and

2016-11-13: Generate meshes
2016-11-13: ???
=============================================================

![MARS with Wireframe](2016-11-13_013_starter_r2322_g3d_r977__MARS_with_Wireframe.jpg)

Can generate obj file from tri array and vertex array. (Currently, we don't specify the normals in the OBJ file, but we can easily edit our toObj code to include them.)

Our mesh class now has most of the functions we think we'll need to begin with. Currently, the initial heightfield is being generated prior to being given to our mesh class, but it will probably happen within our mesh class eventually.

We still are usnure as to how to get an articulated model froma mesh class.

2016-11-13: We have texture
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_011_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)

We got weld to work finally! We now are able to actually bump the vertices with
noise! Right now it's just random nums, but good enough.



2016-11-13: First attempt at using weld
=============================================================

2016-11-13: Sphere with Wireframe and 8 recursion levels
=============================================================

2016-11-13: Attempt at noise function
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_008_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)

Trying to add detail to the planet. Using a random function and adding the
normal to each midpoint position.



2016-11-13: IT IS DONE!
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_007_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)

Turns out... Vector3.unit() does NOT manipulate the vector itself, but returns
the manipulated Vector :(. So, when I used it originally, I wasn't getting it
back.



2016-11-13: Midpoint Works, Bumping them does not
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_006_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)

Our midpoint formula is correct. We knew that really, but it is not bumping the
midpoints correctly so we can get a sphere shape



2016-11-13: The Big Bang
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_005_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)

Still trying to debug and find the midpoints correctly.



2016-11-13: Buggy Sphere with Wireframe
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_004_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)



2016-11-13: Spherical... Sort of
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_003_starter_r2313_g3d_r977__.jpg)

Simple fix, I was doing i+=3 instead of ++i when iterating through the faces. It
looks as though I need to bump the original vertices or something similar. Will
work on it.



2016-11-13: Continue to Debug
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_002_starter_r2309_g3d_r977__.jpg)

It looks as though the midpoint algorithm is wrong. The faces are fixed, but
they seems to either not be following the right hand rule, or not be in the
correct positions



2016-11-13: Attempt at the IcoSphere Algorithm
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_001_starter_r2309_g3d_r977__.jpg)

I might need to change a few things.... Right now it seems as though I am not
calculating the correct midpoints and editing the faces correctly



2016-11-13: We have a sphere and backgound
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_001_starter_r2301_g3d_r977__.jpg)

We found a sphere obj file online which we think has enough vertices and faces
that will allow us to have the detail we need.  We also added a space backgorund
to our Planet scene and set the camera to default to this nice cinematic view.

2016-11-13: We have a Icohedron
=============================================================

We have added a new class Planet, where we will do all of the icohedron transformations. This should help keep the code simple and organized. It also will help us create member variables.

![](2016-11-13_000_starter_r2292_g3d_r977__.jpg)

We wrote a method that writes an off file for a Icohedron.  We will then
tessellate it to make a sphere and then map a texture to it to bump the radius
at each point to create a planet.



2016-11-12: Planning Our Mesh Class
===================================================================
We will use the static functions in the MeshAlg Class to build our own Mesh class. This class will hold the functions needed to create a mesh, and functions for manipulating and mutating the Mesh.
We need to be able to create objs from our Mesh.

As of right now, our design is as follows:

Triangle Parsing:
    - Take the TriTree of the scene containing a prespecified sphere OBJ Model;
    - Parse the TriTree; 
    - Add each triangle to a MeshBuilder; 
    - Create a vertexArray and indexArray using MeshBuilder::commit(), and feed them into our Mesh class

Mesh Class:
    - Instantiated arrays for: vertex positions, vertex indices, MeshAlg::Faces, MeshAlg::Edges, MeshAlg::Vertex;
    - methods to explicitly add to vertex position and vertex index arrays;
    - computeAdjacency() method to set the  MeshAlg::Faces, MeshAlg::Edges, MeshAlg::Vertex arryas through MeshAlg::computeAdjacency;
    - collapseEdges(), bevelEdges() to manipulate the mesh;
    - outputOBJ() method to output the OBJ file;

We wonder if there's a better way to output an OBJ file than to explicitly feed strings into TextOutput.
