2016-11-13: We have a Icohedron
=============================================================

![](2016-11-13_000_starter_r2292_g3d_r977__.jpg)

We wrote a method that writes an off file for a Icohedron.  We will then
tessellate it to make a sphere and then map a texture to it to bump the radius
at each point to create a planet.



2016-11-12: Planning Our Mesh Class
===================================================================
We will use the static functions in the MeshAlg Class to build our own Mesh class. This class will hold the functions needed to create a mesh, and functions for manipulating and mutating the Mesh.
We need to be able to create objs from our Mesh.

As of right now, our design is as follows:

Triangle Parsing:
    - Take the TriTree of the scene containing a prespecified sphere OBJ Model;
    - Parse the TriTree; 
    - Add each triangle to a MeshBuilder; 
    - Create a vertexArray and indexArray using MeshBuilder::commit(), and feed them into our Mesh class

Mesh Class:
    - Instantiated arrays for: vertex positions, vertex indices, MeshAlg::Faces, MeshAlg::Edges, MeshAlg::Vertex;
    - methods to explicitly add to vertex position and vertex index arrays;
    - computeAdjacency() method to set the  MeshAlg::Faces, MeshAlg::Edges, MeshAlg::Vertex arryas through MeshAlg::computeAdjacency;
    - collapseEdges(), bevelEdges() to manipulate the mesh;
    - outputOBJ() method to output the OBJ file;

We wonder if there's a better way to output an OBJ file than to explicitly feed strings into TextOutput.
