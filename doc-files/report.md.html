Introduction
============================================================================================

Despite their lack of realism, low-poly planets have the ability to be aesthetically beautiful and awe-inspiring. 

Specification
============================================================================================

1. Generate a procedurally generated, tesselated planet by implementing the following:
	1. Generate a low-poly planet with the following heightfields:
		1. Sea
		2. Low-Level Terrain
		3. Mountains
	2. Use a noise function to generate these heightfields based on the planet's radius
	3. Use an edge-collapse algorithm to reduce the number of triangles
	4. Bevel the edges of the heightfields' triangles for smoother transitions
	5. Color each position on the heightfield's based on their distance away from the center of the planet
	5. Add low-poly objects on the planet:
		1. Small Cars
		2. Fir Trees
		3. Birds
	6. Make the planet rotate on its axis
	7. Make the cars and birds move along predetermined paths 
	8. Use a gradient background for better aesthetic.

2. Provide the capability to change the planet's following paramenters:
	1. Water heightfield's minimum and maximum height
	2. Love-level terrain heightfield's maximum height
	3. Mountain heightfield's maximum height
	4. The planet's theme:
		1. Water Planet
		2. Ice Planet
		3. Mountaineous Planet
		4. Desert Planet
		5. City Planet
		
3. Save the following images to prove correctness:
    1. Change the color of each triangle as follows:
		1. World-space surface normals of the triangle visualized as colors by $\vec{c} = (\n + 1) / 2$ 
		2. World-space hit positions of the triangle visualized as colors by $\vec{c} = P$
	2. Show a low-poly terrain mesh using a simple noise algorithm to bump the vertices.
    3. Show a planet with only one terrain
	4. Show one example of a planet with various terrains

4. Quality Results:
	1. A scene of a planet with some models and an interesting background
	2. A scene of a planet with a moon rotating around it
	3. A unique scene emphasizing our planets' beauty
  
5. Stretch Goals
	1. Add detailed buildings to the planets
	2. Have one planet revolve around another like a moon
  
Topic Overview
=====================================================================================
Noise
-----------------------------------------------------------
Noise is used to create natural seeming planets.

Heightfields
-----------------------------------------------------------
The planets are represented through a combination of spherical heightfields.

Meshes
----------------------------------------------------------
Thes heightfields are stored as meshes. To create a low-poly planet, we use an edge collapsing algorithm. Smoothing is performe dthrough beveling.

Quality Results
=====================================================================================
Here, we show high quality images that show both the advantages and limitations of our project.

Evocative Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here, we demonstrate how our planets could be used to create with various models to create interesting scenes and beautiful images.
