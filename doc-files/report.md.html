![A low-poly planet generated by our code.](teaser.png border=1)

Introduction
================================



Specification
============================================================================================

1. Code:
	1. Write a planet generator that generates a low-poly planet using three heightfields. These heightfields correspond to the water, low-level terrain, and mountains.
	2. Use a noise function to generate these heightfields. 
	3. Generate a random background, "Sky", for better aesthetic.
	4. Add starship models and other accessories to the scene to make it look realistic.
	5. Add a GUI that allows for adjustments of the planet, such as biomes and/or themes, size, flatness, etc.
  
2. Correctness Results:
    1. Show a low-poly planet with no terrain.
    2. Show a planet with only one terrain.
	3. Show one example of a planet with various terrains.

3. Quality Results:
  1. A scene of a planet with some models and an interesting background.
  2. A scene of a planet with a moon rotating around it.
  3. A unique scene demonstrating the beauty of our code.

Quality Results
=====================================================================================
Here, we show high quality images that show both the advantages and limitations of our project.

Evocative Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here, we demonstrate how our coral could be used to create with various models to create interesting scenes and beautiful images.  These images were created using a Path Tracer written by John, Jose, and Julia.
